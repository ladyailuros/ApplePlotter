Research Notes - 8/12/2024 

Took the plotter apart - checked the spring for the pen change system, it seems intact.  Noted that there were empty sockets on the control board (see pictures)  
Ran self-test with no pen holder installed and cover off and checked out fine. 
Ran self test with pen holder installed and vocer off and checked out fine. 
Ran self test with cover on and pen holder installed and checked out fine. 

Current hypothesis is that the cracks in the pen holder, upon adding the load of pens, are making the rotation system malfunction becuase of how they are loaded -
not having them loaded perfectly may be throwing something off.  Need an intact pen holder to compare, need to look for one. 

I wonder if more RAM was installed in the empty RAM socket on the control board if it would increase the buffer size. 

Also empty ROM sockes, what was Apple planning???
